Selenium-IDE 
============

.. _chapter02-reference:

Introduction 
------------
The Selenium-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the tool you use to 
develop your Selenium test cases.  It's an easy-to-use Firefox plug-in and is 
generally the most efficient way to develop test cases.  It also contains a 
context menu that allows you to first select a UI element from the browser's 
currently displayed page and then select from a list of Selenium commands 
with parameters pre-defined according to the context of the selected UI 
element.  This is not only a time-saver, but also an excellent way of 
learning Selenium script syntax. 
  
This chapter is all about the Selenium IDE and how to use it effectively. 
  
Installing the IDE 
------------------
Using Firefox, first, download the IDE from the SeleniumHQ `downloads page`_
  
.. _`downloads page`: http://seleniumhq.org/download/
  
Firefox will protect you from installing addons from unfamiliar locations, so
you will need to click 'Allow' to proceed with the installation, as shown in the
following screenshot.

   :class: align-center

When downloading from Firefox, you'll be presented with the following window. 
 
.. image:: images/chapt3_img02_IDE_Installation.png
   :class: align-center

Select Install Now. The Firefox Add-ons window pops up, first showing a 
progress bar, and when the download is complete, displays the following. 
  
.. image:: images/chapt3_img03_IDE_Installation.png
   :class: align-center
  
Restart Firefox.  After Firefox reboots you will find the Selenium-IDE listed under the Firefox Tools menu.

Opening the IDE 
---------------
To run the Selenium-IDE, simply select it from the Firefox Tools menu.  It opens 
as follows with an empty script-editing window and a menu for loading, or 
creating new test cases. 

.. image:: images/chapt3_img05_IDE_open.png
   :class: align-center
  
IDE Features  
------------
Menu Bar 
++++++++
The File menu has options for Test Case and Test Suite (suite of Test Cases).
Using these you can add a new Test Case, open a Test Case, save a Test Case,
export Test Case in a language of your choice. You can also open the recent
Test Case. All these options are also available for Test Suite.

The Edit menu allows copy, paste, delete, undo, and select all 
operations for editing the commands in your test case.  The Options menu allows 
the changing of settings.  You can set the timeout value for 
certain commands, add user-defined user extensions to the base set of Selenium 
commands, and specify the format (language) used when saving your 
test cases.  The Help menu is the standard Firefox Help menu; only one
item on this menu--UI-Element Documentation--pertains to Selenium-IDE.
  
Toolbar 
++++++++
The toolbar contains buttons for controlling the execution of your test 
cases, including a step feature for debugging your test cases.  The right-most 
button, the one with the red-dot, is the record button.  
  
.. image:: images/chapt3_img06_IDE_features.png
   :class: align-center
  
|speed control|
    Speed Control:  controls how fast your test case runs. 
|run all|
    Run All: Runs the entire test suite when a test suite with multiple test 
    cases is loaded. 
|run|
    Run:  Runs the currently selected test.  When only a single test is 
    loaded this button and the Run All button have the same effect.  
|pause| |resume|
    Pause/Resume:  Allows stopping and re-starting of a running test case.
|step|
    Step:  Allows you to "step" through a test case by running it one command at a 
    time.  Use for debugging test cases. 
|testrunner|
    TestRunner Mode:  Allows you to run the test case in a browser loaded with 
    the Selenium-Core TestRunner.  The TestRunner is not commonly used now 
    and is likely to be deprecated.  This button is for evaluating test cases
    for backwards compatibility with the TestRunner.  Most users will 
    probably not need this button.   
|rollup|
    Apply Rollup Rules: This advanced feature allows repetitive sequences of
    Selenium commands to be grouped into a single action.  Detailed documentation
    on rollup rules can be found in the UI-Element Documentation on the Help
    menu.

|record|
    Record:  Records the user's browser actions.

Test Case Pane
++++++++++++++
Your script is displayed in the test case pane.  It has two tabs, one for 
displaying the command and their parameters in a readable "table" format.  

.. image:: images/chapt3_img16_Table_Format.png
   :class: align-center
  
The other tab - Source displays the test case in the native format in which the file 
will be stored.  By default, this is HTML although it can be changed to a 
programming language such as Java or C#, or a scripting language like Python.
See the Options menu for details.  The Source view also allows one to edit 
the test case in its raw form, including copy, cut and paste operations. 
  
The Command, Target, and Value entry fields display the currently selected 
command along with its parameters.  These are entry fields where you 
can modify the currently selected command.  The first parameter specified for
a command in the Reference tab of the bottom pane always goes in the Target
field.  If a second parameter is specified by the Reference tab, it always
goes in the Value field.
  
.. image:: images/chapt3_img17_Entry_Fields.png
   :class: align-center
  
If you start typing in the Command field, a drop-down list will be populated 
based on the first characters you type; you can then select your desired 
command from the drop-down. 
  
Log/Reference/UI-Element/Rollup Pane
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The bottom pane is used for four different functions--Log, Reference,
UI-Element, and Rollup--depending on which tab is selected.

Log
~~~

When you run your test case, error messages
and information messages showing the progress are displayed 
in this pane automatically, even if you do not first select the Log
tab.  These messages are often useful for test case debugging.   Notice the Clear 
button for clearing the Log.  Also notice the Info button is a drop-down 
allowing selection of different levels of information to log.  
  
.. image:: images/chapt3_img18_Bottom_Box.png
   :class: align-center

Reference
~~~~~~~~~

The Reference tab is the default selection whenever you are
entering or modifying Selenese_ commands and parameters in Table
mode.  In Table mode, the Reference pane will display documentation on the current command.  When entering or modifying
commands, whether from Table or Source mode, it is critically
important to ensure that the parameters specified in the
Target and Value fields match those specified in the parameter
list in the Reference pane.  The number of parameters provided
must match the number specified, the order of parameters provided must
match the order specified, and the type of parameters provided must match
the type specified.  
If there is a mismatch in any of these three areas, the command will not 
run correctly.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img19_Bottom_Box_Ref.png
   :class: align-center

While the Reference tab is invaluable as a quick reference, it is still often
necessary to consult the Selenium Reference_ document.

UI-Element and Rollup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed information on these two panes (which cover advanced features)
can be found in the 
UI-Element Documentation on the Help menu of Selenium-IDE.
     
Building Test Cases
-------------------
There are three primary methods for developing test cases.  Frequently, 
a test
developer will require all three techniques. 

Recording  
+++++++++
Many first-time users begin by recording a test case from their interactions 
with a website.  When Selenium-IDE is first opened, the record button is ON by 
default. If you do not want Selenium-IDE to begin recording automatically you
can turn this off by going under Options > Options... and deselecting
"Start recording immediately on open."

During recording, Selenium-IDE will automatically insert commands into your 
test case based on 
your actions.  Typically, this will include:
  
* clicking a link - *click* or *clickAndWait* commands 
* entering values - *type* command 
* selecting options from a drop-down listbox - *select* command 
* clicking checkboxes or radio buttons - *click* command 
  
Here are some "gotchas" to be aware of:
  
* The *type* command may require clicking on some other area of the web page 
  for it to record. 
* Following a link usually records a *click* command. You will often need to 
  change this to *clickAndWait* to ensure your test case pauses until the new page 
  is completely loaded.  Otherwise, your test case will continue running commands
  before the page has loaded all its UI elements. This will cause unexpected 
  test case failures.
  
Adding Verifications and Asserts With the Context Menu 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
Your test cases will also need to check the properties of a web-page.  This 
requires *assert* and *verify* commands.  We won't describe the specifics of 
these commands here; that is in the chapter on `Selenium Commands -- "Selenese"`_.  Here we'll 
simply describe how to add them to your test case. 
  
With Selenium-IDE recording, go to the browser displaying your test application and 
right click anywhere on the page.  You will see a context menu showing *verify* 
and/or *assert* commands.  

.. TODO: add image here (it wasn't correctly uploaded in the GDocs version

The first time you use Selenium, there may only be one Selenium command listed.
As you use the IDE however, you will find additional commands will quickly be
added to this menu.  Selenium-IDE will attempt to predict what command, along 
with the parameters, you will need for a selected UI element on the current 
web-page. 
  
Let's see how this works. Open a web-page of your choosing and select a block 
of text on the page. A paragraph or a heading will work fine.  Now, right-click
the selected text.  The context menu should give you a *verifyTextPresent*
command and the suggested parameter should be the text itself. 
  
Also, notice the Show All Available Commands menu option.  This shows many, 
many more commands, again, along with suggested parameters, for testing your 
currently selected UI element. 
  
Try a few more UI elements. Try right-clicking an image, or a user control 
like a button or a checkbox.  You may need to use Show All Available Commands 
to see options other than *verifyTextPresent*. Once you select these other 
options, the more commonly used ones will show up on the primary context menu.
For example, selecting *verifyElementPresent* for an image should later cause 
that command to be available on the primary context menu the next time you 
select an image and right-click. 
  
Again, these commands will be explained in detail in the chapter on Selenium 
commands.  For now though, feel free to use the IDE to record and select 
commands into a test case and then run it.  You can learn a lot about 
the Selenium commands simply by experimenting with the IDE. 
  
Editing  
+++++++
Insert Command 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Table View
__________
Select the point in your test case where you want to insert the command.  
To do this, in the Test Case Pane, left-click on the line where you want 
to insert a new command.  Right-click and select Insert Command; the IDE 
will add a blank line just ahead of the line you selected. Now use the 
command editing text fields to enter your new command and its parameters. 

Source View
___________
Select the point in your test case where you want to insert the command.  
To do this, in the Test Case Pane, left-click between the commands 
where you want to insert a new command, and enter the HTML tags needed
to create a 3-column row containing the Command, first parameter 
(if one is required by the Command), and second parameter (again,
if one is required to locate an element) and third parameter(again, if one is required to have a value).
Example:

.. code-block:: html

    <tr>
        <td>Command</td>
        <td>target (locator)</td>
        <td>Value</td>
    </tr>

  
Insert Comment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Comments may be added to make your test case more readable.  These comments are 
ignored when the test case is run. 

Comments may also be used to add vertical white space (one or more blank lines) 
in your tests; just create empty comments.  An empty command will cause an error
during execution; an empty comment won't.

Table View
__________
Select the line in your test case where you 
want to insert the comment.  Right-click and select Insert Comment.  Now use 
the Command field to enter the comment.  Your comment will appear in purple
text.

Source View
___________
Select the point in your test case where you want to insert the comment.  Add
an HTML-style comment, i.e., ``<!-- your comment here -->``.
  
Edit a Command or Comment 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Table View
__________

Simply select the line to be changed and edit it using the Command, Target,
and Value fields. 

Source View
___________
Since Source view provides the equivalent of a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor, simply modify
which line you wish--command, parameter, or comment.

Opening and Saving a Test Case
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Like most programs, there are Save and Open commands under the File menu.
However, Selenium distinguishes between test cases and test suites.
To save your Selenium-IDE tests for later use you can either save the
individual test cases, or save the test suite. If the test cases of your
test suite have not been saved, you'll be prompted to save them before
saving the test suite.

When you open an existing test case or suite, Selenium-IDE
displays its Selenium commands in the Test Case Pane.
  
Running Test Cases
------------------
  
The IDE allows many options for running your test case. You can run a test case
all at once, stop and start it, run it one line at a time, run a single command 
you are currently developing, and you can do a batch run of an entire test suite.
Execution of test cases is very flexible in the IDE. 
  
Run a Test Case
    Click the Run button to run the currently displayed test case. 
  
Run a Test Suite
    Click the Run All button to run all the test cases in the currently loaded 
    test suite. 
  
Stop and Start
    The Pause button can be used to stop the test case while it is running.  The 
    icon of this button then changes to indicate the Resume button.  To continue
    click Resume. 
  
Stop in the Middle
    You can set a breakpoint in the test case to cause it to stop on a 
    particular command.  This is useful for debugging your test case. To set a 
    breakpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu 
    select Toggle Breakpoint. 
  
Start from the Middle
    You can tell the IDE to begin running from a specific command in the 
    middle of the test case.  This also is used for debugging.  To set a 
    startpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu 
    select Set/Clear Start Point. 
  
Run Any Single Command
    Double-click any single command to run it by itself.  This is useful when 
    writing a single command.  It lets you immediately test a command you are 
    constructing, when you are not sure if it is correct.  You can double-click it to 
    see if it runs correctly.  This is also available from the context menu.
  

Using Base URL to Run Test Cases in Different Domains 
-----------------------------------------------------
The *Base URL* field at the top of the Selenium-IDE window is very useful
for allowing test cases to be run across different domains. 
Suppose that a site named \http://news.portal.com had an in-house beta site named
\http://beta.news.portal.com.  Any test cases for these sites that begin with
an *open*
statement should specify a *relative URL* as the argument to *open*
rather than an *absolute URL* (one
starting with a protocol such as http: or https:).  Selenium-IDE will
then create an absolute URL by appending the *open* command's
argument onto the end of the value of Base URL.  For example, the 
test case below would be run against \http://news.portal.com/about.html:

.. image:: images/chapt3_img21_BaseURL_prod.png
   :class: align-center

This same test case with a modified Base URL setting would be run against
\http://beta.news.portal.com/about.html:

.. image:: images/chapt3_img22_BaseURL_beta.png
   :class: align-center

.. _Selenese:

Selenium Commands -- "Selenese" 
-------------------------------
Selenium commands, often called *selenese*, are the set of commands that run 
your tests.  A sequence of these commands is a *test script*.  Here we explain 
those commands in detail, and we present the many choices you have in testing 
your web application when using Selenium.

Selenium provides a rich set of commands for fully testing your web-app 
in virtually any way you can imagine. The command set is often called 
*selenese*. These commands essentially create a testing language. 

In selenese, one can test the existence of UI elements based 
on their HTML tags, test for specific content, test for broken links, 
input fields, selection list options, submitting forms, and table data among
other things. In addition Selenium commands support testing of window size,
mouse position, alerts, Ajax functionality, pop up windows, event handling,
and many other web-application features. The `Command Reference`_ lists all 
the available commands. 

.. _`Command Reference`: http://release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-core/1.0.1/reference.html

A *command* tells Selenium what to do. Selenium commands come in 
three "flavors": **Actions**, **Accessors**, and **Assertions**. 

* **Actions** are commands that generally manipulate the state of the 
  application. They do things like "click this link" and "select that option". 
  If an Action fails, or has an error, the execution of the current test is 
  stopped. 

  Many Actions can be called with the "AndWait" suffix, e.g. "clickAndWait". 
  This suffix tells Selenium that the action will cause the browser to make a 
  call to the server, and that Selenium should wait for a new page to load. 

* **Accessors** examine the state of the application and store the results in 
  variables, e.g. "storeTitle". They are also used to automatically generate 
  Assertions. 

* **Assertions** are like Accessors, but they verify that the state of the 
  application conforms to what is expected. Examples include "make sure the 
  page title is X" and "verify that this checkbox is checked". 

  All Selenium Assertions can be used in 3 modes: "assert", "verify", and "
  waitFor". For example, you can "assertText", "verifyText" and "waitForText". 
  When an "assert" fails, the test is aborted. When a "verify" fails, the test 
  will continue execution, logging the failure. This allows a single "assert" 
  to ensure that the application is on the correct page, followed by a bunch of 
  "verify" assertions to test form field values, labels, etc. 

  "waitFor" commands wait for some condition to become true (which can be 
  useful for testing Ajax applications). They will succeed immediately if the 
  condition is already true. However, they will fail and halt the test if the 
  condition does not become true within the current timeout setting (see the 
  setTimeout action below). 
  
.. Peter: setTimeout doesn't yet exist in this document. I'll assume it's 
   going in the Commonly Used Selenium Commands section. Is there somewhere
   else this should link to?

Script Syntax 
-------------
Selenium commands are simple, they consist of the command and two parameters. 
For example:

==========  ===========  =====
verifyText  //div//a[2]  Login 
==========  ===========  =====

The parameters are not always required; it depends on the command. In some 
cases both are required, in others one parameter is required, and in still 
others the command may take no parameters at all. Here are a couple more 
examples:
  
=================  ===========   =======================
goBackAndWait 
verifyTextPresent                Welcome to My Home Page 
type               id=phone      \(555\) 666-7066 
type               id=address1   \\${myVariableAddress} 
=================  ===========   =======================
 
The command reference describes the parameter requirements for each command. 
  
Parameters vary, however they are typically:
  
* a *locator* for identifying a UI element within a page. 
* a *text pattern* for verifying or asserting expected page content 
* a *text pattern* or a selenium variable for entering text in an input field 
  or for selecting an option from an option list. 

Locators, text patterns, 
selenium variables, and the commands themselves are described in considerable
detail in the section on Selenium Commands. 
  
Selenium scripts that will be run from Selenium-IDE will be be stored in an HTML
text file format. This consists of an HTML table with three columns. The first
column identifies the Selenium command, the second is a target, and the
final column contains a value. The second and third columns may not require
values depending on the chosen Selenium command, but they should be present.
Each table row represents a new Selenium command. Here is an example of a test
that opens a page, asserts the page title and then verifies some content on the
page:
           
.. code-block:: html

   <table>
       <tr><td>open</td><td>/download/</td><td></td></tr>
       <tr><td>assertTitle</td><td></td><td>Downloads</td></tr>
       <tr><td>verifyText</td><td>//h2</td><td>Downloads</td></tr>
   </table>

Rendered as a table in a browser this would look like the following:

===========  ==========  =========
open         /download/  
assertTitle              Downloads
verifyText   //h2        Downloads
===========  ==========  =========

The Selenese HTML syntax can be used to write and run tests without requiring 
knowledge of a programming language.  With a basic knowledge of selenese and 
Selenium-IDE you can quickly produce and run testcases.
   
Test Suites 
------------
A test suite is a collection of tests.  Often one will run all the tests in a
test suite as one continuous batch-job.  

When using Selenium-IDE, test suites also can be defined using a simple HTML 
file.  The syntax again is simple.  An HTML table defines a list of tests where
each row defines the filesystem path to each test.  An example tells it all.

.. code-block:: html

      <html> 
      <head> 
      <title>Test Suite Function Tests - Priority 1</title> 
      </head> 
      <body> 
      <table> 
        <tr><td><b>Suite Of Tests</b></td></tr> 
        <tr><td><a href="./Login.html">Login</a></td></tr> 
        <tr><td><a href="./SearchValues.html">Test Searching for Values</a></td></tr> 
        <tr><td><a href="./SaveValues.html">Test Save</a></td></tr> 
      </table> 
      </body> 
      </html>  

A file similar to this would allow running the tests all at once, one after
another, from the Selenium-IDE.

Test suites can also be maintained when using Selenium-RC.  This is done via
programming and can be done a number of ways.  Commonly Junit is used to
maintain a test suite if one is using Selenium-RC with Java.  Additionally, if
C# is the chosen language, Nunit could be employed.  If using an interpreted 
language like Python with Selenium-RC then some simple programming would be
involved in setting up a test suite.  Since the whole reason for using Selenium-RC
is to make use of programming logic for your testing this usually isn't a
problem.

Commonly Used Selenium Commands 
--------------------------------
To conclude our introduction of Selenium, we'll show you a few typical Selenium
commands.  These are probably the most commonly used commands for building tests.

open
   opens a page using a URL.
click/clickAndWait
   performs a click operation, and optionally waits for a new page to load.
verifyTitle/assertTitle
   verifies an expected page title.
verifyTextPresent
   verifies expected text is somewhere on the page.
verifyElementPresent
   verifies an expected UI element, as defined by its HTML tag, is present on
   the page.
verifyText
   verifies expected text and its corresponding HTML tag are present on the page.
verifyTable
   verifies a table's expected contents.
waitForPageToLoad
   pauses execution until an expected new page loads.  Called automatically when 
   clickAndWait is used.
waitForElementPresent
   pauses execution until an expected UI element, as defined by its HTML tag,
   is present on the page. 

 

Verifying Page Elements
------------------------
Verifying UI elements on a web page is probably the most common feature of 
your automated tests.  Selenese allows multiple ways of checking for UI 
elements.  It is important that you understand these different methods because
these methods define what you are actually testing.

For example, will you test that...

a) an element is present somewhere on the page?
b) specific text is somewhere on the page?
c) specific text is at a specific location on the page?

For example, if you are testing a text heading, the text and its position
at the top of the page are probably relevant for your test.  If, however, you 
are testing for the existence of an image on the home page, and the 
web designers frequently change the specific image file along with its position
on the page, then you only want to test that *an image* (as opposed to the 
specific image file) exists *somewhere on the page*.
   
   
Assertion or Verification? 
--------------------------
Choosing between "assert" and "verify" comes down to convenience and 
management of failures. There's very little point checking that the first 
paragraph on the page is the correct one if your test has already failed when 
checking that the browser is displaying the expected page. If you're not on 
the correct page, you'll probably want to abort your test case so that you can 
investigate the cause and fix the issue(s) promptly. On the other hand, you 
may want to check many attributes of a page without aborting the test case on 
the first failure as this will allow you to review all failures on the page 
and take the appropriate action. Effectively an "assert" will fail the test 
and abort the current test case, whereas a "verify" will fail the test and 
continue to run the test case. 

The best use of this feature is to logically group your test commands, and 
start each group with an "assert" followed by one or more "verify" test 
commands. An example follows:

============    ==========  ============
**Command**     **Target**  **Value**
============    ==========  ============
open            /download/      
assertTitle     Downloads       
verifyText      //h2        Downloads       
assertTable     1.2.1       Selenium IDE    
verifyTable     1.2.2       June 3, 2008    
verifyTable     1.2.3       1.0 beta 2      
============    ==========  ============

The above example first opens a page and then "asserts" that the correct page 
is loaded by comparing the title with the expected value. Only if this passes 
will the following command run and "verify" that the text is present in the 
expected location. The test case then "asserts" the first column in the second
row of the first table contains the expected value, and only if this passed will 
the remaining cells in that row be "verified".


verifyTextPresent
+++++++++++++++++
The command ``verifyTextPresent`` is used to verify *specific text exists 
somewhere on the page*.  It takes a single argument--the text pattern to be 
verified.  For example:

=================   ==================   ============
**Command**         **Target**           **Value**
=================   ==================   ============
verifyTextPresent   Marketing Analysis 
=================   ==================   ============

This would cause Selenium to search for, and verify, that the text string
"Marketing Analysis" appears somewhere on the page currently being tested. Use
``verifyTextPresent`` when you are interested in only the text 
itself being present on the page.  Do not use this when you also need to test 
where the text occurs on the page. 

verifyElementPresent
++++++++++++++++++++
Use this command when you must test for the presence of a specific UI 
element, rather than its content.  This verification does not check the text,
only the HTML tag.  One common use is to check for the presence of an image. 

====================   ==================   ============
**Command**            **Target**           **Value**
====================   ==================   ============
verifyElementPresent   //div/p/img               
====================   ==================   ============
   
This command verifies that an image, specified by the existence of an <img> 
HTML tag, is present on the page, and that it follows a <div> tag and a <p> tag.
The first (and only) parameter is a *locator* for telling the Selenese command how to 
find the element.  Locators are explained in the next section.  

``verifyElementPresent`` can be used to check the existence of any HTML tag 
within the page. You can check the existence of links, paragraphs, divisions 
<div>, etc.  Here are a few more examples.  

====================   ==============================	============
**Command**            **Target**           		**Value**
====================   ==============================   ============
verifyElementPresent   //div/p 
verifyElementPresent   //div/a               
verifyElementPresent   id=Login
verifyElementPresent   link=Go to Marketing Research               
verifyElementPresent   //a[2]
verifyElementPresent   //head/title
====================   ==============================   ============

These examples illustrate the variety of ways a UI element may be tested.  
Again, locators are explained in the next section.

verifyText
++++++++++
.. TODO mam-p:  Why the parenthetical limitation on locator type below?  The locator could also be name=, id=, identifier=, etc.

Use ``verifyText`` when both the text and its UI element must be tested.
``verifyText`` must use a locator.  If you choose an *XPath* or *DOM*
locator, you can verify that specific text appears at a specific location on the
page relative to other UI components on the page.

===========  ===================    ===================================================================
**Command**  **Target**  	    **Value**
===========  ===================    ===================================================================
verifyText   //table/tr/td/div/p    This is my text and it occurs right after the div inside the table.
===========  ===================    ===================================================================


.. _locators-section:

Locating Elements 
-----------------
For many Selenium commands, a target is required. This target identifies an 
element in the content of the web application, and consists of the location 
strategy followed by the location in the format ``locatorType=location``. The 
locator type can be omitted in many cases.
The various locator types
are explained below with examples for each.

.. Santi: I really liked how this section was taken. But I found that most of
   the locator strategies repeat the same HTML fragment over a over. Couldn't
   we put A example HTML code before starting with each strategie and then use
   that one on all of them?

Locating by Identifier
++++++++++++++++++++++
This is probably the most common method of locating elements and is the 
catch-all default when no recognized locator type is used. With this strategy,
the first element with the id attribute value matching the location will be used. If
no element has a matching id attribute, then the first element with a name 
attribute matching the location will be used.

For instance, your page source could have id and name attributes 
as follows:
           
.. code-block:: html
  :linenos: 

  <html>
   <body>
    <form id="loginForm">
     <input name="username" type="text" />
     <input name="password" type="password" />
     <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
    </form>
   </body>
  <html>

The following locator strategies would return the elements from the HTML 
snippet above indicated by line number:

- ``identifier=loginForm`` (3)
- ``identifier=password`` (5)
- ``identifier=continue`` (6)
- ``continue`` (6)

Since the ``identifier`` type of locator is the default, the ``identifier=``
in the first three examples above is not necessary.

Locating by Id 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This type of locator is more limited than the identifier locator type, but 
also more explicit. Use this when you know an element's id attribute.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:
  
   <html>
    <body>
     <form id="loginForm">
      <input name="username" type="text" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
      <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
     </form>
    </body>
   <html>

- ``id=loginForm`` (3)

Locating by Name 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The name locator type will locate the first element with a matching name 
attribute. If multiple elements have the same value for a name attribute, then 
you can use filters to further refine your location strategy. The default 
filter type is value (matching the value attribute).  

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:
  
   <html>
    <body>
     <form id="loginForm">
      <input name="username" type="text" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
      <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
     </form>
   </body>
   <html>

- ``name=username`` (4)
- ``name=continue value=Clear`` (7)
- ``name=continue Clear`` (7)
- ``name=continue type=button`` (7)

.. note:: Unlike some types of XPath and DOM locators, the three
   types of locators above allow Selenium to test a UI element independent 
   of its location on 
   the page.  So if the page structure and organization is altered, the test 
   will still pass.  You may or may not want to also test whether the page 
   structure changes.  In the case where web designers frequently alter the 
   page, but its functionality must be regression tested, testing via id and 
   name attributes, or really via any HTML property, becomes very important.

Locating by XPath 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can 
be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful 
language to target elements in their web applications. XPath extends beyond (as 
well as supporting) the simple methods of locating by id or name 
attributes, and opens up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating the 
third checkbox on the page.

.. Dave: Is it worth mentioning the varying support of XPath (native in 
   Firefox, using Google AJAXSLT or the new method in IE)? Probably an 
   advanced topic if needed at all..?

One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don't have a suitable id 
or name attribute for the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to 
either locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or relative to an 
element that does have an id or name attribute.  XPath locators can also be
used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name.

Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and 
as a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the 
application. By finding a nearby element with an id or name attribute (ideally
a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the relationship.
This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust.

Since only ``xpath`` locators start with "//", it is not necessary to include
the ``xpath=`` label when specifying an XPath locator.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:
  
   <html>
    <body>
     <form id="loginForm">
      <input name="username" type="text" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
      <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
     </form>
   </body>
   <html>

.. TODO: mam-p:  Is the fourth example below correct?

- ``xpath=/html/body/form[1]`` (3) - *Absolute path (would break if the HTML was 
  changed only slightly)*
- ``//form[1]`` (3) - *First form element in the HTML*
- ``xpath=//form[@id='loginForm']`` (3) - *The form element with attribute named 'id' and the value 'loginForm'*
- ``xpath=//form[input/@name='username']`` (3) - *First form element with an input child
  element with attribute named 'name' and the value 'username'*
- ``//input[@name='username']`` (4) - *First input element with attribute named 'name' and the value 
  'username'*
- ``//form[@id='loginForm']/input[1]`` (4) - *First input child element of the 
  form element with attribute named 'id' and the value 'loginForm'*
- ``//input[@name='continue'][@type='button']`` (7) - *Input with attribute named 'name' and the value 'continue'
  and attribute named 'type' and the value 'button'*
- ``//form[@id='loginForm']/input[4]`` (7) - *Fourth input child element of the 
  form element with attribute named 'id' and value 'loginForm'*

These examples cover some basics, but in order to learn more, the 
following references are recommended:

* `W3Schools XPath Tutorial <http://www.w3schools.com/Xpath/>`_ 
* `W3C XPath Recommendation <http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath>`_

There are also a couple of very useful Firefox Add-ons that can assist in 
discovering the XPath of an element:

* `XPath Checker 
  <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1095?id=1095>`_ - suggests 
  XPath and can be used to test XPath results. 
* `Firebug <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843>`_ -  XPath 
  suggestions are just one of the many powerful features of this very useful add-on.

Locating Hyperlinks by Link Text 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO: mam-p:  Users often are unaware that a link locator is a pattern, 
   not just a string.  So, I think we need an example here that necessitates 
   a link=regexp:pattern locator in the test case.

This is a simple method of locating a hyperlink in your web page by using the 
text of the link. If two links with the same text are present, then the first 
match will be used.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:

  <html>
   <body>
    <p>Are you sure you want to do this?</p>
    <a href="continue.html">Continue</a> 
    <a href="cancel.html">Cancel</a>
  </body>
  <html>

- ``link=Continue`` (4)
- ``link=Cancel`` (5)

Locating by DOM  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Document Object Model represents an HTML document and can be accessed 
using JavaScript. This location strategy takes JavaScript that evaluates to 
an element on the page, which can be simply the element's location using the 
hierarchical dotted notation.

Since only ``dom`` locators start with "document", it is not necessary to include
the ``dom=`` label when specifying a DOM locator.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:

   <html>
    <body>
     <form id="loginForm">
      <input name="username" type="text" />
      <input name="password" type="password" />
      <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
      <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
     </form>
   </body>
   <html>

- ``dom=document.getElementById('loginForm')`` (3)
- ``dom=document.forms['loginForm']`` (3)
- ``dom=document.forms[0]`` (3)
- ``document.forms[0].username`` (4)
- ``document.forms[0].elements['username']`` (4)
- ``document.forms[0].elements[0]`` (4)
- ``document.forms[0].elements[3]`` (7)

You can use Selenium itself as well as other sites and extensions to explore
the DOM of your web application. A good reference exists on `W3Schools
<http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp>`_. 

Locating by CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the rendering of HTML
and XML documents. CSS uses Selectors for binding style properties to elements
in the document. These Selectors can be used by Selenium as another locating 
strategy.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:

   <html>
    <body>
     <form id="loginForm">
      <input class="required" name="username" type="text" />
      <input class="required passfield" name="password" type="password" />
      <input name="continue" type="submit" value="Login" />
      <input name="continue" type="button" value="Clear" />
     </form>
   </body>
   <html>

- ``css=form#loginForm`` (3)
- ``css=input[name="username"]`` (4)
- ``css=input.required[type="text"]`` (4)
- ``css=input.passfield`` (5)
- ``css=#loginForm input[type="button"]`` (7)
- ``css=#loginForm input:nth-child(2)`` (5)

For more information about CSS Selectors, the best place to go is `the W3C 
publication <http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/>`_.  You'll find additional
references there.

.. note:: Most experienced Selenium users recommend CSS as their locating
   strategy of choice as it's considerably faster than XPath and can find the 
   most complicated objects in an intrinsic HTML document.

Implicit Locators 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can choose to omit the locator type in the following situations:

 - Locators without an explicitly defined locator strategy will default
   to using the identifier locator strategy. See `Locating by Identifier`_.
   
 - Locators starting with "//" will use the XPath locator strategy. 
   See `Locating by XPath`_.   
 
 - Locators starting with "document" will use the DOM locator strategy. 
   See `Locating by DOM`_

.. _patterns-section:

Matching Text Patterns
----------------------
Like locators, *patterns* are a type of parameter frequently required by Selenese
commands.  Examples of commands which require patterns are **verifyTextPresent**,
**verifyTitle**, **verifyAlert**, **assertConfirmation**, **verifyText**, and 
**verifyPrompt**.  And as has been mentioned above, link locators can utilize 
a pattern.  Patterns allow you to *describe*, via the use of special characters,
what text is expected rather than having to specify that text exactly.

There are three types of patterns: *globbing*, *regular expressions*, and *exact*.

Globbing Patterns
+++++++++++++++++
Most people are familiar with globbing as it is utilized in
filename expansion at a DOS or Unix/Linux command line such as ``ls *.c``.
In this case, globbing is used to display all the files ending with a ``.c`` 
extension that exist in the current directory.  Globbing is fairly limited.  
Only two special characters are supported in the Selenium implementation:

    **\*** which translates to "match anything," i.e., nothing, a single character, or many characters.

    **[ ]** (*character class*) which translates to "match any single character 
    found inside the square brackets." A dash (hyphen) can be used as a shorthand
    to specify a range of characters (which are contiguous in the ASCII character
    set).  A few examples will make the functionality of a character class clear:

    ``[aeiou]`` matches any lowercase vowel

    ``[0-9]`` matches any digit

    ``[a-zA-Z0-9]`` matches any alphanumeric character

In most other contexts, globbing includes a third special character, the **?**.
However, Selenium globbing patterns only support the asterisk and character
class.

To specify a globbing pattern parameter for a Selenese command, you can
prefix the pattern with a **glob:** label.  However, because globbing
patterns are the default, you can also omit the label and specify just the
pattern itself.

Below is an example of two commands that use globbing patterns.  The
actual link text on the page being tested
was "Film/Television Department"; by using a pattern
rather than the exact text, the **click** command will work even if the
link text is changed to "Film & Television Department" or "Film and Television
Department".  The glob pattern's asterisk will match "anything or nothing"
between the word "Film" and the word "Television".

===========   ====================================    =========
**Command**   **Target**                              **Value**
===========   ====================================    =========
click         link=glob:Film*Television Department
verifyTitle   glob:\*Film\*Television\*
===========   ====================================    =========

The actual title of the page reached by clicking on the link was "De Anza Film And
Television Department - Menu".  By using a pattern rather than the exact
text, the ``verifyTitle`` will pass as long as the two words "Film" and "Television" appear
(in that order) anywhere in the page's title.  For example, if 
the page's owner should shorten
the title to just "Film & Television Department," the test would still pass.
Using a pattern for both a link and a simple test that the link worked (such as
the ``verifyTitle`` above does) can greatly reduce the maintenance for such
test cases.

Regular Expression Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Regular expression* patterns are the most powerful of the three types
of patterns that Selenese supports.  Regular expressions
are also supported by most high-level programming languages, many text
editors, and a host of tools, including the Linux/Unix command-line
utilities **grep**, **sed**, and **awk**.  In Selenese, regular
expression patterns allow a user to perform many tasks that would
be very difficult otherwise.  For example, suppose your test needed
to ensure that a particular table cell contained nothing but a number.
``regexp: [0-9]+`` is a simple pattern that will match a decimal number of any length.

Whereas Selenese globbing patterns support only the **\*** 
and **[ ]** (character
class) features, Selenese regular expression patterns offer the same
wide array of special characters that exist in JavaScript.  Below 
are a subset of those special characters:

=============     ======================================================================
    PATTERN            MATCH
=============     ======================================================================
   .              any single character
   [ ]            character class: any single character that appears inside the brackets 
   \*             quantifier: 0 or more of the preceding character (or group)
   \+             quantifier: 1 or more of the preceding character (or group)
   ?              quantifier: 0 or 1 of the preceding character (or group)
   {1,5}          quantifier: 1 through 5 of the preceding character (or group)
   \|             alternation: the character/group on the left or the character/group on
                  the right
   ( )            grouping: often used with alternation and/or quantifier
=============     ======================================================================

Regular expression patterns in Selenese need to be prefixed with
either ``regexp:`` or ``regexpi:``.  The former is case-sensitive; the
latter is case-insensitive.

A few examples will help clarify how regular expression patterns can
be used with Selenese commands.  The first one uses what is probably
the most commonly used regular expression pattern--**.\*** ("dot star").  This
two-character sequence can be translated as "0 or more occurrences of
any character" or more simply, "anything or nothing."  It is the
equivalent of the one-character globbing pattern **\*** (a single asterisk).

===========   =======================================    =========
**Command**   **Target**                                 **Value**
===========   =======================================    =========
click         link=regexp:Film.*Television Department
verifyTitle   regexp:.\*Film.\*Television.\*
===========   =======================================    =========

The example above is functionally equivalent to the earlier example
that used globbing patterns for this same test.  The only differences
are the prefix (**regexp:** instead of **glob:**) and the "anything
or nothing" pattern (**.\*** instead of just **\***).

The more complex example below tests that the Yahoo!
Weather page for Anchorage, Alaska contains info on the sunrise time:

==================  ===============================================    =========
**Command**         **Target**                                         **Value**
==================  ===============================================    =========
open                http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/USAK0012.html
verifyTextPresent   regexp:Sunrise: \*[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2} [ap]m
==================  ===============================================    =========

Let's examine the regular expression above one part at a time:

==============   ====================================================
``Sunrise: *``   The string **Sunrise:** followed by 0 or more spaces
``[0-9]{1,2}``   1 or 2 digits (for the hour of the day)
``:``            The character **:** (no special characters involved)
``[0-9]{2}``     2 digits (for the minutes) followed by a space
``[ap]m``        "a" or "p" followed by "m" (am or pm)
==============   ====================================================

Exact Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **exact** type of Selenium pattern is of marginal usefulness.
It uses no special characters at all.  So, if you needed to look for
an actual asterisk character (which is special for both globbing and
regular expression patterns), the **exact** pattern would be one way
to do that.  For example, if you wanted to select an item labeled
"Real \*" from a dropdown, the following code might work or it might not.
The asterisk in the ``glob:Real *`` pattern will match anything or nothing.
So, if there was an earlier select option labeled "Real Numbers," it would
be the option selected rather than the "Real \*" option.

===========   ====================================    =============
select        //select                                glob:Real \*
===========   ====================================    =============

In order to ensure that the "Real \*" item would be selected, the ``exact:``
prefix could be used to create an **exact** pattern as shown below:

===========   ====================================    =============
select        //select                                exact:Real \*
===========   ====================================    =============

But the same effect could be achieved via escaping the asterisk in a
regular expression pattern:
 
===========   ====================================    ================
select        //select                                regexp:Real \\\*
===========   ====================================    ================

It's rather unlikely that most testers will ever need to look for
an asterisk or a set of square brackets with characters inside them (the
character class for globbing patterns).  Thus, globbing patterns and
regular expression patterns are sufficient for the vast majority of us.


The "AndWait" Commands 
----------------------
The difference between a command and its *AndWait*
alternative is that the regular command (e.g. *click*) will do the action and
continue with the following command as fast as it can, while the *AndWait*
alternative (e.g. *clickAndWait*) tells Selenium to **wait** for the page to
load after the action has been done. 

.. TODO: mam-p:  I don't believe the following is true, at least in Selenium-
   IDE.  Perhaps it is supposed to be true, but I don't think we should 
   misrepresent the current status. 

The *AndWait* alternative is always used when the action causes the browser to
navigate to another page or reload the present one. 

Be aware, if you use an *AndWait* command for an action that
does not trigger a navigation/refresh, your test will fail. This happens 
because Selenium will reach the *AndWait*'s timeout without seeing any 
navigation or refresh being made, causing Selenium to raise a timeout 
exception.
 
.. _waitfor:

The waitFor Commands in AJAX applications
-----------------------------------------
In AJAX driven web applications, data is retrieved from server without 
refreshing the page. Using *andWait* commands will not work as the page is not 
actually refreshed. Pausing the test execution for a certain period of time is 
also not a good approach as web element might appear later or earlier than the 
stipulated period depending on the system's responsiveness, load or other 
uncontrolled factors of the moment, leading to test failures. The best approach 
would be to wait for the needed element in a dynamic period and then continue 
the execution as soon as the element is found.

This is done using *waitFor* commands, as *waitForElementPresent* or
*waitForVisible*, which wait dynamically, checking for the desired condition
every second and continuing to the next command in the script as soon as the 
condition is met.

Sequence of Evaluation and Flow Control
---------------------------------------
When a script runs, it simply runs in sequence, one command after another.

Selenese, by itself, does not support condition statements (if-else, etc.) or 
iteration (for, while, etc.). Many useful tests can be conducted without flow 
control. However, for a functional test of dynamic content, possibly involving
multiple pages, programming logic is often needed.

When flow control is needed, there are three options:  

a) Run the script using Selenium-RC and a client library such as Java or
   PHP to utilize the programming language's flow control features.
b) Run a small JavaScript snippet from within the script using the storeEval command.
c) Install the `goto_sel_ide.js extension`_.

Most testers will export the test script into a programming language file that uses the
Selenium-RC API (see the Selenium-IDE chapter).  However, some organizations prefer
to run their scripts from Selenium-IDE whenever possible (for instance, when they have
many junior-level people running tests for them, or when programming skills are
lacking). If this is your case, consider a JavaScript snippet or the goto_sel_ide.js extension.  

 
Store Commands and Selenium Variables
-------------------------------------
You can use Selenium variables to store constants at the 
beginning of a script.  Also, when combined with a data-driven test design 
(discussed in a later section), Selenium variables can be used to store values 
passed to your test program from the command-line, from another program, or from
a file.
 
The plain *store* command is the most basic of the many store commands and can be used 
to simply store a constant value in a selenium variable.  It takes two 
parameters, the text value to be stored and a selenium variable.  Use the 
standard variable naming conventions of only alphanumeric characters when 
choosing a name for your variable.

.. TODO: mam-p:  Why are we telling them the last sentence above?  Any 
   JavaScript identifiershould be okay, no?

============   ===============	 =========
**Command**    **Target**        **Value**
============   ===============   =========
store          paul@mysite.org   userName               
============   ===============   =========

Later in your script, you'll want to use the stored value of your 
variable.  To access the value of a variable, enclose the variable in 
curly brackets ({}) and precede it with a dollar sign like this.

============  ==========  ===========
**Command**   **Target**  **Value**
============  ==========  ===========
verifyText    //div/p     \\${userName}               
============  ==========  ===========

A common use of variables is for storing input for an input field.

============  ==========   ===========
**Command**   **Target**   **Value**
============  ==========   ===========
type	      id=login     \\${userName}               
============  ==========   ===========

Selenium variables can be used in either the first or second parameter and 
are interpreted by Selenium prior to any other operations performed by the 
command.  A Selenium variable may also be used within a locator expression.

An equivalent store command exists for each verify and assert command.  Here 
are a couple more commonly used store commands.

storeElementPresent 
+++++++++++++++++++
This corresponds to verifyElementPresent.  It simply stores a boolean value--"true" 
or "false"--depending on whether the UI element is found.

storeText 
+++++++++
StoreText corresponds to verifyText.  It uses a locater to identify specific 
page text.  The text, if found, is stored in the variable.  StoreText can be 
used to extract text from the page being tested.

storeEval 
+++++++++
This command takes a script as its 
first parameter.  Embedding JavaScript within Selenese is covered in the next section.
StoreEval allows the test to store the result of running the script in a variable.


JavaScript and Selenese Parameters
----------------------------------
JavaScript can be used with two types of Selenese parameters: script
and non-script (usually expressions).  In most cases, you'll want to access 
and/or manipulate a test case variable inside the JavaScript snippet used as 
a Selenese parameter.  All variables created in your test case are stored in 
a JavaScript *associative array*.  An associative array has string indexes 
rather than sequential numeric indexes.  The associative array containing 
your test case's variables is named **storedVars**.  Whenever you wish to 
access or manipulate a variable within a JavaScript snippet, you must refer 
to it as **storedVars['yourVariableName']**.

JavaScript Usage with Script Parameters  
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Several Selenese commands specify a **script** parameter including
**assertEval**, **verifyEval**, **storeEval**, and **waitForEval**.
These parameters require no special syntax.  A Selenium-IDE
user would simply place a snippet of JavaScript code into
the  appropriate field, normally the **Target** field (because
a **script** parameter is normally the first or only parameter).

The example below illustrates how a JavaScript snippet
can be used to perform a simple numerical calculation:

===============    ============================================   ===========
**Command**        **Target**                                     **Value**
===============    ============================================   ===========
store              10                                             hits
storeXpathCount    //blockquote                                   blockquotes
storeEval          storedVars['hits']-storedVars['blockquotes']   paragraphs
===============    ============================================   ===========

This next example illustrates how a JavaScript snippet can include calls to 
methods, in this case the JavaScript String object's ``toUpperCase`` method 
and ``toLowerCase`` method.  

===============    ============================================   ===========
**Command**        **Target**                                     **Value**
===============    ============================================   ===========
store              Edith Wharton                                  name
storeEval          storedVars['name'].toUpperCase()               uc
storeEval          storedVars['name'].toLowerCase()               lc
===============    ============================================   ===========

JavaScript Usage with Non-Script Parameters  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JavaScript can also be used to help generate values for parameters, even
when the parameter is not specified to be of type **script**.  
However, in this case, special syntax is required--the JavaScript
snippet must be enclosed inside curly braces and preceded by the
label ``javascript``, as in ``javascript {*yourCodeHere*}``.
Below is an example in which the ``type`` command's second parameter 
``value`` is generated via JavaScript code using this special syntax:

===============    ============================================   ===========
**Command**        **Target**                                     **Value**
===============    ============================================   ===========
store              league of nations                              searchString
type               q                                              javascript{storedVars['searchString'].toUpperCase()}
===============    ============================================   ===========

*echo* - The Selenese Print Command
------------------------------------
Selenese has a simple command that allows you to print text to your test's 
output.  This is useful for providing informational progress notes in your 
test which display on the console as your test is running.  These notes also can be 
used to provide context within your test result reports, which can be useful 
for finding where a defect exists on a page in the event your test finds a 
problem.  Finally, echo statements can be used to print the contents of 
Selenium variables.

============       ========================   =========
**Command**        **Target**                 **Value**
============   	   ========================   =========
echo    	   Testing page footer now.    
echo    	   Username is \\${userName}                 
============   	   ========================   =========


Alerts, Popups, and Multiple Windows
------------------------------------
Suppose that you are testing a page that looks like this.

.. code-block:: html
  :linenos:
  
  <!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <html>
  <head>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function output(resultText){
        document.getElementById('output').childNodes[0].nodeValue=resultText;
      }

      function show_confirm(){
        var confirmation=confirm("Chose an option.");
        if (confirmation==true){
          output("Confirmed.");
        }
        else{
          output("Rejected!");
        }
      }
      
      function show_alert(){
        alert("I'm blocking!");
        output("Alert is gone.");
      }
      function show_prompt(){
        var response = prompt("What's the best web QA tool?","Selenium");
        output(response);
      }
      function open_window(windowName){
        window.open("newWindow.html",windowName);
      }
      </script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <input type="button" id="btnConfirm" onclick="show_confirm()" value="Show confirm box" />
    <input type="button" id="btnAlert" onclick="show_alert()" value="Show alert" />
    <input type="button" id="btnPrompt" onclick="show_prompt()" value="Show prompt" />
    <a href="newWindow.html" id="lnkNewWindow" target="_blank">New Window Link</a>
    <input type="button" id="btnNewNamelessWindow" onclick="open_window()" value="Open Nameless Window" />
    <input type="button" id="btnNewNamedWindow" onclick="open_window('Mike')" value="Open Named Window" />

    <br />
    <span id="output">
    </span>
  </body>
  </html>

The user must respond to alert/confirm boxes, as well as moving focus to newly 
opened popup windows. Fortunately, Selenium can cover JavaScript pop-ups.

But before we begin covering alerts/confirms/prompts in individual detail, it is
helpful to understand the commonality between them. Alerts, confirmation boxes 
and prompts all have variations of the following 

===========================     ================================================================
**Command**                     **Description**
===========================     ================================================================
assertFoo(*pattern*)            throws error if *pattern* doesn't match the text of the pop-up
assertFooPresent                throws error if pop-up is not available
assertFooNotPresent             throws error if any pop-up is present
storeFoo(*variable*)            stores the text of the pop-up in a variable
storeFooPresent(*variable*)     stores the text of the pop-up in a variable and returns true or false
===========================     ================================================================

When running under Selenium, JavaScript pop-ups will not appear. This is because
the function calls are actually being overridden at runtime by Selenium's own
JavaScript. However, just because you cannot see the pop-up doesn't mean you don't
have to deal with it. To handle a pop-up, you must call its ``assertFoo(pattern)``
function. If you fail to assert the presence of a pop-up your next command will be 
blocked and you will get an error similar to the following ``[error] Error: There
was an unexpected Confirmation! [Chose an option.]``

Alerts
++++++
Let's start with alerts because they are the simplest pop-up to handle. To begin,
open the HTML sample above in a browser and click on the "Show alert" button. You'll
notice that after you close the alert the text "Alert is gone." is displayed on the
page. Now run through the same steps with Selenium IDE recording, and verify
the text is added after you close the alert. Your test will look something like
this:

==================    ============================================   ===========
 **Command**           **Target**                                     **Value**
==================    ============================================   ===========
open                   /                                             
click                  btnAlert                                       
assertAlert            I'm blocking!
verifyTextPresent      Alert is gone.
==================    ============================================   ===========

You may be thinking "That's odd, I never tried to assert that alert." But this is
Selenium-IDE handling and closing the alert for you. If you remove that step and replay
the test you will get the following error ``[error] Error: There was an unexpected
Alert! [I'm blocking!]``. You must include an assertion of the alert to acknowledge 
its presence.
 
If you just want to assert that an alert is present but either don't know or don't care
what text it contains, you can use ``assertAlertPresent``. This will return true or false,
with false halting the test.

Confirmations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Confirmations behave in much the same way as alerts, with ``assertConfirmation`` and
``assertConfirmationPresent`` offering the same characteristics as their alert counterparts.
However, by default Selenium will select OK when a confirmation pops up. Try recording
clicking on the "Show confirm box" button in the sample page, but click on the "Cancel" button
in the popup, then assert the output text. Your test may look something like this:

===============================    ============================================   ===========
 **Command**                        **Target**                                     **Value**
===============================    ============================================   ===========
open                                     /                                             
click                                    btnConfirm                                       
chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation
assertConfirmation                       Choose an option.
verifyTextPresent                        Rejected
===============================    ============================================   ===========

The ``chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation`` function tells Selenium that all following
confirmation should return false. It can be reset by calling chooseOkOnNextConfirmation.

You may notice that you cannot replay this test, because Selenium complains that there
is an unhandled confirmation. This is because the order of events Selenium-IDE records
causes the click and chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation to be put in the wrong order (it makes sense 
if you think about it, Selenium can't know that you're cancelling before you open a confirmation)
Simply switch these two commands and your test will run fine.



Debugging 
---------
Debugging means finding and fixing errors in your test case.  This is a normal 
part of test case development. 
  
We won't teach debugging here as most new users to Selenium will already have 
some basic experience with debugging.  If this is new to you, we recommend 
you ask one of the developers in your organization. 
  
.. TODO: mam-p: The two sections below have a great deal of overlap with "Running Test Cases" above.

Breakpoints and Startpoints 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 
The Sel-IDE supports the setting of breakpoints and the ability to start and 
stop the running of a test case, from any point within the test case.  That is, one 
can run up to a specific command in the middle of the test case and inspect how 
the test case behaves at that point.  To do this, set a breakpoint on the 
command just before the one to be examined.  
  
To set a breakpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context menu 
select *Toggle Breakpoint*.  Then click the Run button to run your test case from 
the beginning up to the breakpoint. 
  
It is also sometimes useful to run a test case from somewhere in the middle to 
the end of the test case or up to a breakpoint that follows the starting point.  
For example, suppose your test case first logs into the website and then 
performs a series of tests and you are trying to debug one of those tests.  
However, you only need to login once, but you need to keep rerunning your 
tests as you are developing them.  You can login once, then run your test case
from a startpoint placed after the login portion of your test case.  That will 
prevent you from having to manually logout each time you rerun your test case. 
  
To set a startpoint, select a command, right-click, and from the context 
menu select *Set/Clear Start Point*.  Then click the Run button to execute the 
test case beginning at that startpoint. 
  
Stepping Through a Testcase
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To execute a test case one command at a time ("step through" it), follow these
steps:

1. Start the test case running with the Run button from the toolbar.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img09_Run.png

2. Immediately pause the executing test case with the Pause button.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img10_Pause.png

3. Repeatedly select the Step button.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img12_Step.png

Find Button 
+++++++++++
The Find button is used to see which UI element on the currently displayed 
webpage (in the browser) is used in the currently selected Selenium command.  
This is useful when building a locator for a command's first parameter (see the
section on :ref:`locators <locators-section>` in the Selenium Commands chapter).
It can be used with any command that identifies a UI element on a webpage, 
i.e. *click*, *clickAndWait*, *type*, and certain *assert* and *verify* commands, 
among others. 
  
From Table view, select any command that has a locator parameter.
Click the Find button.  
Now look on the webpage: There should be a bright green rectangle
enclosing the element specified by the locator parameter. 

Page Source for Debugging 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Often, when debugging a test case, you simply must look at the page source (the 
HTML for the webpage you're trying to test) to determine a problem.  Firefox 
makes this easy.  Simply right-click the webpage and select 'View->Page Source.  
The HTML opens in a separate window.  Use its Search feature (Edit=>Find)
to search for a keyword to find the HTML for the UI element you're trying 
to test. 

Alternatively, select just that portion of the webpage for which you want to
see the source.  Then right-click the webpage and select View Selection
Source.  In this case, the separate HTML window will contain just a small
amount of source, with highlighting on the portion representing your
selection.

Locator Assistance
++++++++++++++++++
Whenever Selenium-IDE records a locator-type argument, it stores
additional information which allows the user to view other possible 
locator-type arguments that could be used instead.  This feature can be
very useful for learning more about locators, and is often needed to help
one build a different type of locator than the type that was recorded.  

This locator assistance is presented on the Selenium-IDE window as a drop-down
list accessible at the right end of the Target field 
(only when the Target field contains a recorded locator-type argument).  
Below is a snapshot showing the
contents of this drop-down for one command.  Note that the first column of
the drop-down provides alternative locators, whereas the second column
indicates the type of each alternative.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img23_IDE_Locator_Assistance.png

Writing a Test Suite 
--------------------
A test suite is a collection of test cases which is displayed in the leftmost
pane in the IDE.  
The test suite pane can be manually opened or closed via selecting a small dot
halfway down the right edge of the pane (which is the left edge of the 
entire Selenium-IDE window if the pane is closed).

The test suite pane will be automatically opened when an existing test suite 
is opened *or* when the user selects the New Test Case item from the
File menu.  In the latter case, the new test case will appear immediately
below the previous test case.

Selenium-IDE also supports loading pre-existing test cases by using the File 
-> Add Test Case menu option.  This allows you to add existing test cases to 
a new test suite.

A test suite file is an HTML file containing a one-column table.  Each
cell of each row in the <tbody> section contains a link to a test case.
The example below is of a test suite containing four test cases:

.. code-block:: html

	<html>
        <head>
            <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
            <title>Sample Selenium Test Suite</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" border="1">
                <thead>
                    <tr><td>Test Cases for De Anza A-Z Directory Links</td></tr>
                </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td><a href="./a.html">A Links</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="./b.html">B Links</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="./c.html">C Links</a></td></tr>
                <tr><td><a href="./d.html">D Links</a></td></tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
        </body>
	</html>
	
.. note::
   Test case files should not have to be co-located with the test suite file
   that invokes them.  And on Mac OS and Linux systems, that is indeed the
   case.  However, at the time of this writing, a bug prevents Windows users
   from being able to place the test cases elsewhere than with the test suite
   that invokes them.

.. do some testing here of test suites—do they save correctly?
   I've seen errors in the past. 
  
User Extensions 
---------------
User extensions are JavaScript files that allow one to create his or her own 
customizations and features to add additional functionality.  Often this is in 
the form of customized commands although this extensibility is not limited to 
additional commands.  
  
There are a number of useful extensions_ created by users.

*IMPORTANT:  THIS SECTION IS OUT OF DATE--WE WILL BE REVISING THIS SOON.*

.. _extensions: http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SEL/Contributed+User-Extensions

.. _`goto_sel_ide.js extension`:

Perhaps the most popular of all Selenium-IDE extensions
is one which provides flow control in the form of while loops and primitive
conditionals.  This extension is the goto_sel_ide.js_.  For an example
of how to use the functionality provided by this extension, look at the
page_ created by its author.

.. _goto_sel_ide.js: http://wiki.openqa.org/download/attachments/379/goto_sel_ide.js
.. _page: http://51elliot.blogspot.com/2008/02/selenium-ide-goto.html

To install this extension, put the pathname to its location on your
computer in the **Selenium Core extensions** field of Selenium-IDE's
Options=>Options=>General tab.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img32_Extensions_install.png
   :class: align-center

After selecting the **OK** button, you must close and reopen Selenium-IDE
in order for the extensions file to be read.  Any change you make to an
extension will also require you to close and reopen Selenium-IDE.

Information on writing your own extensions can be found near the
bottom of the Selenium Reference_ document.

.. _Reference: http://release.openqa.org/selenium-core/1.0/reference.html

.. TODO:  mam-p: need info on how to install user extensions, especially on the diff
   between "Selenium Core Extensions" and "Selenium IDE" extensions on the
   Options=>Options=>General page.

Format 
------
Format, under the Options menu, allows you to select a language for saving 
and displaying the test case.  The default is HTML.
  
If you will be using Selenium-RC to run your test cases, this feature is used 
to translate your test case into a programming language. Select the 
language, e.g. Java, PHP, you will be using with Selenium-RC for developing 
your test programs.  Then simply save the test case using File=>Export Test Case As.
Your test case will be translated into a series of functions in the language you 
choose. Essentially, program code supporting your test is generated for you 
by Selenium-IDE. 
  
Also, note that if the generated code does not suit your needs, you can alter 
it by editing a configuration file which defines the generation process.  
Each supported language has configuration settings which are editable.  This 
is under the Options=>Options=>Formats tab. 
  
.. TODO: Add the steps here to change the format. 
  
.. note::
   At the time of this writing, this feature is not yet supported by the Selenium 
   developers.  However the author has altered the C# format in a limited 
   manner and it has worked well. 
  
Executing Selenium-IDE Tests on Different Browsers
--------------------------------------------------
While Selenium-IDE can only run tests against Firefox, tests
developed with Selenium-IDE can be run against other browsers, using a
simple command-line interface that invokes the Selenium-RC server.  This topic
is covered in the :ref:`Run Selenese tests <html-suite>` section on Selenium-RC
chapter. The *-htmlSuite* command-line option is the particular feature of interest.

Troubleshooting
---------------
Below is a list of image/explanation pairs which describe frequent
sources of problems with Selenium-IDE:

*Table view is not available with this format.* 

This message can be occasionally displayed in the Table tab when Selenium IDE is
launched. The workaround is to close and reopen Selenium IDE. See `issue 1008`_.
for more information. If you are able to reproduce this reliably then please
provide details so that we can work on a fix.

.. _issue 1008: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1008

------------------

*error loading test case: no command found*

You've used **File=>Open** to try to open a test suite file. Use **File=>Open
Test Suite** instead.

An enhancement request has been raised to improve this error message. See
`issue 1010`_.

.. _issue 1010: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1010

------------------

.. image:: images/chapt3_img28_Trouble_timing.png

This type of **error** may indicate a timing problem, i.e., the element 
specified by a locator in your command wasn't fully loaded when the command 
was executed.  Try putting a **pause 5000** before the command to determine 
whether the problem is indeed related to timing.  If so, investigate using an 
appropriate **waitFor\*** or **\*AndWait** command before the failing command.

------------------

.. image:: images/chapt3_img29_Trouble_param.png

Whenever your attempt to use variable substitution fails as is the
case for the **open** command above, it indicates
that you haven't actually created the variable whose value you're
trying to access.  This is 
sometimes due to putting the variable in the **Value** field when it 
should be in the **Target** field or vice versa.  In the example above,
the two parameters for the **store** command have been erroneously
placed in the reverse order of what is required.
For any Selenese command, the first required parameter must go 
in the **Target** field, and the second required parameter (if one exists) 
must go in the **Value** field.  

----------

*error loading test case: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:

One of the test cases in your test suite cannot be found.  Make sure that the
test case is indeed located where the test suite indicates it is located.  Also,
make sure that your actual test case files have the .html extension both in
their filenames, and in the test suite file where they are referenced.

An enhancement request has been raised to improve this error message. See
`issue 1011`_.

.. image:: images/chapt3_img27_Trouble_extension.png

Your extension file's contents have not been read by Selenium-IDE.  Be 
sure you have specified the proper pathname to the extensions file via 
**Options=>Options=>General** in the **Selenium Core extensions** field.
Also, Selenium-IDE must be restarted after any change to either an
extensions file *or* to the contents of the **Selenium Core extensions**
field.

Selenium IDE 
============

.. _chapter02-reference:

The Selenium-IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the tool you use to 
develop your Selenium test cases.  It's an easy-to-use Chrome and Firefox extension 
and is generally the most efficient way to develop test cases.   It records 
the users actions in the browser for you, using existing Selenium commands, 
with parameters defined by the context of that element.  This is not only a 
time-saver, but also an excellent way of learning Selenium script syntax.

Selenium-Grid
=============

.. _chapter07-reference:

*Note:  We are currently working on this chapter.  Presently we have introductory info here for people
completely new to Selnium-Grid.  Over the next few months we hope to provide useful examples and illustrations
to thoroughly explain how to use Selenium-Grid.*

Quick Start
-----------
If you're already experienced in Selenium test automation you may simply need a quick-start to get
up and running.  This chapter has much information geared to many skill levels, but may be too much
if you're looking for just a quick reference to quickly try things out.  For a quick-start, refer
to the Selenium-Grid articles in the `Selenium Wiki <http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2>`_.


What is Selenium-Grid?
----------------------
Selenium-Grid allows you run your tests on different machines against
different browsers in parallel.  That is, running multiple tests at the same time against 
different machines running different browsers and operating systems.  Essentially, Selenium-Grid
support distributed test execution.  It allows for running your tests in 
a *distributed test execution* environment.  


When to Use It
--------------

Generally speaking, there's two reasons why you might want to use Selenium-Grid.

- To run your tests against multiple browsers, multiple versions of browser, and browsers running on different operating systems.
- To reduce the time it takes for the test suite to complete a test pass.


Selenium-Grid is used to speed up the execution of a test pass by using multiple machines to run
tests in parallel.  For example, if you have a suite of 100 tests, but you set up Selenium-Grid
to support 4 different machines (VMs or separate physical machines) to run those tests, your test
suite will complete in (roughly) one-fourth the time as it would if you ran your tests sequentially
on a single machine.  For large test suites, and long-running test suite such as those performing
large amounts of data-validation, this can be a significant time-saver.  Some test suites can take
hours to run.  Another reason to boost the time spent running the suite is to shorten the 
turnaround time for test results after developers check-in code for the AUT.  Increasingly 
software teams practicing Agile software development want test feedback as immediately as possible
as opposed to wait overnight for an overnight test pass.

Selenium-Grid is also used to support running tests against multiple runtime environments, specifically,
against different browsers at the same time.  For example, a 'grid' of virtual machines can be
setup with each supporting a different browser that the application to be tested must support.  So, 
machine 1 has Internet Explorer 8, machine 2, Internet Explorer 9, machine 3 the latest Chrome, and
machine 4 the latest Firefox.  When the test suite is run, Selenium-Grid receives each test-browser
combination and assigs each test to run against it's required browser.

In addition, one can have a grid of all the same browser, type and version.  For instance, one
could have a grid of 4 machines each running 3 instances of Firefox 12, allowing for a 'server-farm'
(in a sense) of available Firefox instances.  When the suite runs, each test is passed to
Selenium-Grid which assigns the test to the next available Firefox instance.  In this manner
one gets test pass where conceivably 12 tests are all running at the same time in parallel, 
significantly reducing the time required to complete a test pass.

Selenium-Grid is very flexible.  These two examples can be combined to allow multiple instances
of each browser type and version.  A configuration such as this would provide both, parallel
execution for fast test pass completion and support for multiple browser types and versions
simultaneously.


Selenium-Grid 2.0
-----------------
Selenium-Grid 2.0 is the latest release as of the writing of this document (5/26/2012).  It is
quite different from version 1 of Selenium-Grid.  In 2.0 Selenium-Grid was merged with the
Selenium-RC server.  Now, you only need to download a single .jar file to get the remote 
Selenium-RC-Server and Selenium-Grid all in one package.


Selenium-Grid 1.0
-----------------
Version 1 was the first general release of Selenium-Grid.  If you are new to Selenium-Grid you should
use version 2.  It's been updated and has new features, and supports Selenium-WebDriver.  Legacy
test systems may still be using version 1 however.  Information on Selenium-Grid version 1 may be 
found at the `Selenium-Grid website <http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/>`_.


How Selenium-Grid Works--With a Hub and Nodes
---------------------------------------------
A grid consists of a single hub, and one or more nodes.  Both are started using the 
selenium-server.jar executable.  We've listed some examples in the following sections of this 
chapter.

The hub receives a test to be executed along with information on which
browser and 'platform' (i.e. WINDOWS, LINUX, etc) where the test should be run.  It 'knows' the 
configuration of each node that has been 'registered' to the hub.  Using this information it
selects an available node that has the requested browser-platform combination.  Once a node has
been selected, Selenium commands initiated by the test are sent to the hub, which passes them to
the node assigned to that test.  The node runs the browser, and executes the Selenium commands
within that browser against the application under test.

A `diagram <http://selenium-grid.seleniumhq.org/how_it_works.html>`_ illustrates this.  Refer to the
second diagram on this page (the first one is illustrating Selenium-RC).  The second diagram was for 
Selenium-Grid 1, however it still applies and is a good illustration of what we're describing here.
The only difference is one of terminology.
Replace the term 'Selenium Remote Control' with 'Selenium-Grid node' the diagram will match our
description for Selenium-Grid 2.


Installation
------------
Installation is simple.  Download the Selenium-Server jar file from the `SeleniumHq website's 
download page <http://seleniumhq.org/download/>`_.  You want the link under the section
"Selenium-Server (formerly Selenium-RC)".

Install it in a folder of your choice.  You'll need to be sure the java executable is on your
execution path so you can run it from the command-line.  If it does not run correcly, verify
your system's path variable includes the path to the java.exe.


Starting Selenium-Grid
----------------------
Generally you would start a hub first since nodes depend on a hub.  This is not abolutely necessary
however, since nodes can recognize when a hub has been started and vice-versa.  For learning 
purposes though, it would easier to start the hub first, otherwise you'll see error
messages that may not want to start off with your first time using Selenium-Grid.


Starting a Hub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start a hub with default parameters, run the following command from a command-line shell.  This
will work on all the supported platforms, Windows Linux, or Mac OSX.

.. code-block:: bash

    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -role hub
    
This starts a hub using default parameter values.  We'll explain these parameters in folowing 
subsections.  Note that you will likely have to change the version number in the jar filename 
depending on which version of the selenium-server you're using.


Starting a Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start a node using default parameters, run the following command from a command-line.

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -role node  -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register

This assumes the hub has been started above using default parameters.  The default port the hub
uses to listen for new requests is port 4444.  This is why port 4444 was used in the URL for 
locating the hub.  Also the use of 'localhost' assumes your node is running on the same machine
as your hub.  For getting started this is probably easiest.  If running the hub and node on 
separate machines, simply replace 'localhost' with the hostname of the remote machine running the
hub.

WARNING:  Be sure to turn off the firewalls on the machine running your hub and nodes.  Otherwise
you may get connection errors.

Hub Configuration
-----------------
To run the hub using the default options simply specify -role hub to the Selenim-Server

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -hub

You should see the following logging output.

.. code-block:: bash
	
	Jul 19, 2012 10:46:21 AM org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher main
	INFO: Launching a selenium grid server
	2012-07-19 10:46:25.082:INFO:osjs.Server:jetty-7.x.y-SNAPSHOT
	2012-07-19 10:46:25.151:INFO:osjsh.ContextHandler:started o.s.j.s.ServletContextHandler{/,null}
	2012-07-19 10:46:25.185:INFO:osjs.AbstractConnector:Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0:4444


Specifying the Port
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default port used by the hub is 4444.  The port being referred to hear, is the TCP/IP port used when the 
'client', that is, the automated tests connect to the Selenium-Grid hub.  If another application
on your computer is already using this port, or if, you already have a Selenium-Server started,
you'll see the following message in the log output.

.. code-block:: bash

	10:56:35.490 WARN - Failed to start: SocketListener0@0.0.0.0:4444
	Exception in thread "main" java.net.BindException: Selenium is already running on port 4444. Or some other service is.

If this occurs you can either shutdown the other process that is using port 4444, or you can 
tell Selenium-Grid to use a different port for its hub.  Use the -port option for changing the 
port used by the hub.

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -role hub -port 4441

This will work even if another hub is already running on the same machine, that is, as long as
they're both not using port 4441.

You may, however, want to see what process is using port 4444 so you can allow the hub to use the 
default.  To see the ports used by all running programs on your machine use the command.

.. code-block:: bash

	netstat -a
	
This should work on all supported systems, Unix/Linux, MacOs, and Windows although additional options
beyond -a may be required.  Basically you need to display the process ID along with the port.  In 
Unix you may 'grep' the output (use a pipe) from the port number to only display those records 
you're concerned with.

Getting Command-Line Help
-------------------------
The Selenium-Server provides listings of available options with a brief description of each.
Currently (summer 2012), the command-line help has some oddities, but it can be helpful if you know
where to look and how to interpret the information.  

The Selenium-Server provides two distinct functions, that of the Selenium-RC server
and that of Selenium-Grid.  These were likely written by different Selenium teams, and therefore 
the command-line help for each function has ended up in two different places.  And, for the 
new user, it may not be apparent at first which of these two you are viewing.

If you simply pass a -h option as you might first assume, you get the Selenium-RC Server options
but not those for Selenium-Grid. 

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -h
	
This would give you Selenium-RC's server options.  If you want the command-line help for 
Selenium-Grid, you first use the -hub or -node options to tell Selenium-Server you're interested
in Selenium-Grid, and then follow with a -h.

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -role node -h

Or, for that matter, just pass a garbage argument to the -role node as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar -role node xx


You will first see "INFO..." and an "ERROR" but below that you'll get the command-line options for
Selenium-Grid.  We won't list the whole output here since it's rather long, but the first few
lines look like this.

.. code-block:: bash

	Jul 19, 2012 10:10:39 AM org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher main
	INFO: Launching a selenium grid node

Common Errors
-------------


Unable to acess the jarfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

	Unable to access jarfile selenium-server-standalone-2.38.0.jar

This error can occur when starting up either a hub or node.  
This means Java cannot find the selenium-server jar file.  Either run the command from the
directory where the selenium-server-XXXX.jar file is stored, or specify an explicit path to
the jar.

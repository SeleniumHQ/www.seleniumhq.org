Introduction
------------
Extending Selenium by adding your own actions, assertions and locator-strategies
can be quite simple. Add JavaScript methods to the Selenium object prototype and
the PageBot object prototype. On startup, Selenium will automatically look through
methods on these prototypes, using name patterns to recognize which ones are actions, 
assertions and locators. The following examples give an indication of how Selenium 
can be extended with JavaScript.

Actions
-------

All methods on the Selenium prototype beginning with "do" are added as actions.
For each action foo there is also an action fooAndWait registered. An action 
method can take up to two parameters, which will be passed the second and 
third column values in the test.
Example: Add a "typeRepeated" action to Selenium, which types the text twice 
into a text box.

.. code-block:: javascript

        Selenium.prototype.doTypeRepeated = function(locator, text) {
            // All locator-strategies are automatically handled by "findElement"
            var element = this.page().findElement(locator);

            // Create the text to type
            var valueToType = text + text;

            // Replace the element text with the new text
            this.page().replaceText(element, valueToType);
        };
        
Accessors/Assertions
--------------------
All \ *get*\Foo and \ *is*\Foo methods on the Selenium prototype are added as accessors 
(storeFoo). For each accessor there is an assertFoo, verifyFoo and waitForFoo 
registered. An assert method can take up to 2 parameters, which will be 
passed the second and third column values in the test. You can also define 
your own assertions literally as simple "assert" methods, which will also 
auto-generate "verify" and "waitFor" commands.
Example: Add a valueRepeated assertion, that makes sure that the element 
value consists of the supplied text repeated. The 2 commands that would be 
available in tests would be assertValueRepeated and verifyValueRepeated.

.. code-block:: javascript

        Selenium.prototype.assertValueRepeated = function(locator, text) {
            // All locator-strategies are automatically handled by "findElement"
            var element = this.page().findElement(locator);

            // Create the text to verify
            var expectedValue = text + text;

            // Get the actual element value
            var actualValue = element.value;

            // Make sure the actual value matches the expected
            Assert.matches(expectedValue, actualValue);
        };

Prototype generates additional commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All \ *get*\Foo and \ *is*\Foo methods on the Selenium prototype automatically result 
in the availability of storeFoo, assertFoo, assertNotFoo, verifyFoo, 
verifyNotFoo, waitForFoo, and waitForNotFoo commands.
Example, if you add a ``getTextLength()`` method, the following commands will 
automatically be available: ``storeTextLength``, ``assertTextLength``, 
``assertNotTextLength``, ``verifyTextLength``, ``verifyNotTextLength``, 
``waitForTextLength``, and ``waitForNotTextLength`` commands.

.. code-block:: javascript

        Selenium.prototype.getTextLength = function(locator, text) {
            return this.getText(locator).length;
        };

Also note that the ``assertValueRepeated`` method described above could have 
been implemented using ``isValueRepeated``, with the added benefit of also 
automatically getting assertNotValueRepeated, storeValueRepeated, 
waitForValueRepeated and waitForNotValueRepeated.

Locator Strategies
------------------
All locateElementByFoo methods on the PageBot prototype are added as 
locator-strategies. A locator strategy takes 2 parameters, the first being the 
locator string (minus the prefix), and the second being the document in which 
to search.
Example: Add a "valuerepeated=" locator, that finds the first element a value 
attribute equal to the the supplied value repeated.

.. code-block:: javascript

        // The "inDocument" is a the document you are searching.
        PageBot.prototype.locateElementByValueRepeated = function(text, inDocument) {
            // Create the text to search for
            var expectedValue = text + text;

            // Loop through all elements, looking for ones that have 
            // a value === our expected value
            var allElements = inDocument.getElementsByTagName("*");
            for (var i = 0; i < allElements.length; i++) {
                var testElement = allElements[i];
                if (testElement.value && testElement.value === expectedValue) {
                    return testElement;
                }
            }
            return null;
        };

Using User-Extensions With Selenium-IDE
---------------------------------------
User-extensions are very easy to use with the selenium IDE. 

1. Create your user extension and save it as user-extensions.js. While this 
   name isn't technically necessary, it's good practice to keep things 
   consistent.
2. Open Firefox and open Selenium-IDE.
3. Click on Tools, Options
4. In Selenium Core Extensions click on Browse and find the user-extensions.
   js file. Click on OK.
5. Your user-extension will not yet be loaded, you must close and restart 
   Selenium-IDE.
#. In your empty test, create a new command, your user-extension should now 
   be an options in the Commands dropdown.

Using User-Extensions With Selenium RC
--------------------------------------
If you Google "Selenium RC user-extension" ten times you will find ten 
different approaches to using this feature. Below, is the official Selenium 
suggested approach.

Example
~~~~~~~
**C#**

1. Place your user extension in the same directory as your Selenium Server.
2. If you are using client code generated by the Selenium-IDE you will need 
   to make a couple of small edits. First, you will need to create an 
   ``HttpCommandProcessor`` object with class scope (outside the SetupTest 
   method, just below  ``private StringBuilder verificationErrors;``)

.. code-block:: c#

	HttpCommandProcessor proc;

3. Next, instantiate that ``HttpCommandProcessor`` object as you would the ``DefaultSelenium`` object. This can be done in the test setup.

.. code-block:: c#

	proc = new HttpCommandProcessor("localhost", 4444, "*iexplore", "http://google.ca/");

4. Instantiate the DefaultSelenium object using the ``HttpCommandProcessor`` object you created.

.. code-block:: c#

	selenium = new DefaultSelenium(proc);

5. Within your test code, execute your user-extension by calling it with the 
   ``DoCommand()`` method of ``HttpCommandProcessor``. This method takes two 
   arguments: a string to identify the user-extension method you want to use 
   and string array to pass arguments. Notice that the first letter of your 
   function is lower case, regardless of the capitalization in your 
   user-extension. Selenium automatically does this to keep common JavaScript 
   naming conventions. Because JavaScript is case sensitive, your test will 
   fail if you begin this command with a capital. inputParams is the array of 
   arguments you want to pass to the JavaScript user-extension. In this case 
   there is only one string in the array because there is only one parameter 
   for our user extension, but a longer array will map each index to the 
   corresponding user-extension parameter. Remember that user extensions 
   designed for Selenium-IDE will only take two arguments.


.. code-block:: c#

	string[] inputParams = {"Hello World"};
	proc.DoCommand("alertWrapper", inputParams);


6. Start the test server using the ``-userExtensions`` argument and pass in 
   your ``user-extensions.js`` file. 

.. code-block:: bash

	java -jar selenium-server.jar -userExtensions user-extensions.js


.. code-block:: csharp

		using System;
		using System.Text;
		using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
		using System.Threading;
		using NUnit.Framework;
		using Selenium;

		namespace SeleniumTests
		{
			[TestFixture]
			public class NewTest
			{
				
				private ISelenium selenium;
				private StringBuilder verificationErrors;
				private HttpCommandProcessor proc;

				[SetUp]
				public void SetupTest()
				{
					proc = new HttpCommandProcessor("localhost", 4444, "*iexplore", "http://google.ca/");
					selenium = new DefaultSelenium(proc);
					//selenium = new DefaultSelenium("localhost", 4444, "*iexplore", "http://google.ca/");
					selenium.Start();
					verificationErrors = new StringBuilder();

				}

				[TearDown]
				public void TeardownTest()
				{
					try
					{
						selenium.Stop();
					}
					catch (Exception)
					{
						// Ignore errors if unable to close the browser
					}
					Assert.AreEqual("", verificationErrors.ToString());
				}

				[Test]
				public void TheNewTest()
				{
					selenium.Open("/");
					string[] inputParams = {"Hello World",};
					proc.DoCommand("alertWrapper", inputParams);
				}
			}
		}

<h1>Getting Involved with Selenium</h1>

<p>Selenium is certainly a team effort! There are several ways you can help out,
    whether you&#8217;re a programmer, designer, QA engineer, writer, project manager, or
    just willing to help. If you&#8217;re interested in helping, the best way to connect
    with us is at the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers">Selenium Developers Group</a>. We&#8217;ll work with
    you to get you set up to contribute.</p>

<p>You can help by...</p>

    <h2>Answering Questions in the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">User
        Group</a></h2>

    <p>We get a lot of questions and we have a great community to help answer them.
        If you could register and log into the <a class="reference external"
                                                  href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">user group</a> to
        answer a question or two, that
        would be great! There are often some very basic questions that are easy to
        answer.</p>

<div class="section" id="updating-our-website">
    <h2>Updating our Website</h2>

    <p>We have a lot of out-of-date information that needs to be tidied up on the site!
        Help by writing documentation, producing helpful diagrams, re-skinning the
        website, or organizing content.</p>

    <p>You can get started on working with the website by following the instructions on
       <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Documentation">our wiki.</a>
    </p>

    <p>Feel free to post questions on the <a class="reference external"
                                             href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developers">Selenium
        Developers Group</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-documentation">
    <h2>Writing Documentation</h2>

    <p>For the most part, our documentation is held in source control for the main website. The main documentation is in
        plain text
        so use your favorite editor offline to edit the pages. The source for this main
        site is <a class="reference external" href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/websites/www.seleniumhq.org/">here</a>
        and if you are familiar with Subversion you should be able to
        bring it down to your local system for offline editing.</p>

    <div class="section" id="submitting-documentation-bugs">
        <h3>Submitting Documentation &#8220;Bugs&#8221;</h3>

        <p>If you find an error in our documentation, either a &#8220;typo&#8221; or innaccurate information. Please let
        us know. You can submit these in our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list" class="reference external">
           bug tracker</a> with the label "docs".</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-reports-and-feature-requests">
    <h2>Bug Reports and Feature Requests</h2>

    <p>If you run into a problem with Selenium, feel free to file a bug report about
    it on <a class="reference external"
    href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list">our Bug Tracker</a>.
    Similarly, if you have an idea for a feature you&#8217;d like to see in a
    future version, report that as well.</p>

    <p>Also, we would love help going through the bug reports and adding comments (which
    automatically get sent to the reporter) for cases where advice is all that is needed.
    When reporting bugs, the following templates should be used:</p>

    <p>Bug template:</p>

    <div class="highlight-python"><pre>Description
===========
...
Steps to reproduce
==================
...
Expected
========
...
Actual
======
...</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Feature / change request template:</p>

    <div class="highlight-python"><pre>Description
===========
...
Reason
======
...
Benefits
========
...
Drawbacks
=========
...</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="admonition note">
        <p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>

        <p class="last">Although these templates help the clear structuring of an issue, please
            keep in mind that bugs have to be reproducible and feature / change
            requests have to be understandable!</p>
    </div>
    <p>If you&#8217;re a programmer and are skilled in the language in question, then dive
        in and see if you can fix the bug (see <a class="reference internal" href="#contributing-code-to-selenium">Contributing
            Code to Selenium</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributing-code-to-selenium">
    <h2>Contributing Code to Selenium</h2>

    <p>Much of the magic behind Selenium is the hard work of programmers with
        backgrounds in Javascript, Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, Perl, C#, HTML and other
        languages. If you haven&#8217;t already, you can download the source code from our
        Subversion repository at: <a class="reference external" href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk">http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk</a></p>
	
    <p>We encourage code patches and other contributions - get involved by posting
        to the <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developer">Selenium
            Developers Group</a>. You can also track the activity of the development team by checking out the read-only <a class="reference external" href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-developer-activity">Selenium Developer Activity Group</a>.</p>

            found in the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openqa.org/display/SRC/Developer%27s+Guide">Developer&#8217;s

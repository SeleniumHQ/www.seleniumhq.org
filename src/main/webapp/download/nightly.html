  <h2>Nightly Releases</h2>

  <p>Selenium has nightly builds running every night. Most are
  contained in our <a href="maven.html">Maven repository</a>. In
  the future, we may provide the nightly releases in another
  location, but for now please navigate the <b>snapshots</b> Maven
  repository to find our nightlies.</p>

  <p>Note: Even if you're not using Java, you can find non-Java
  components in these repositories, so please browser around. For
  example, you can find the nightlies for the Ruby, Python, perl,
  and C# bindings in these repositories.</p>

<body>
  <p>The Selenium developers gathered at Google in Mountain View,
  California for 2 days of coding on February 24 &amp; 25,
  2008.</p>

  <p>At the end of the second day, a user evening took place with
  users coming in for all over the bay area.</p>

  <p>Two videos were made by Google covering the user evening. The
  first was a series of lightening talks that went way over the one
  hour estimated:</p>

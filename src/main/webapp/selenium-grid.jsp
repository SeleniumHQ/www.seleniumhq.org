<p>This additional server piece allows the several
Remote Control servers to accessed in parallel by one or more driving
processes. &nbsp;You may want to do this if you want to use scale
to
speed everything up, or because you need to test on Mac and/or Linux,
as well as Windows from one driving test-suite.</p>

<h1>Getting Help</h1>

<p>If you find any problems using Selenium, there are several places where you can
search for help and where volunteers like you and me will spend their time
trying to help you save yours.</p>


<h2>User Group</h2>

<p>The first place where people ask for help about Selenium is the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users">Official User Group</a>.
Here, you'll find that most of the time, someone already found the problem you
are facing right now, and usually reached the solution for which you are
looking.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: Please make sure to search the group before asking for something. Your
question likely won't get answered if it was previously answered in another
discussion!</p>
</div>

<h2 id="IRC">Chat Room</h2>

<p>The best place to ask for help is the user group (because they also keep the
information accessible for others to read in the future). However, if you have a very
important (or too simple) issue that needs a solution ASAP, you can always enter
the IRC chat room. You might just find someone ready to help on <em>#selenium at
Freenode</em> (irc.freenode.net). There is more info about 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc">IRC on wikipedia</a><br/>
Today's <a href="javascript:(function(){var date=(function(){var d=new Date();d=new Date(d.getTime() + (d.getTimezoneOffset())*60000);m=d.getMonth()+1;if(m<10)m='0'+m;day=d.getDate();if(day<10)day='0'+day;return (d.getYear()+1900)+'/'+m+'/'+day;})();window.location='http://www.illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/'+date+'.txt';})();">Selenium IRC Chat log</a>. You can bookmark this link to always get
the current day's log.
</p>

<h2 id="BugTracker">Bug Tracker</h2>
<p>
Selenium's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/list">
Bug Tracker</a> can be used to log new bugs, check the status of an existing
one or as inspiration to help make Selenium better.
